      title="Shower fittings for glass showers: die-cast zinc as a solution! "
      paragraph="With the Glass Center North we always have the ideal shower solution for your needs. We rely on our comprehensive expertise in our high-quality glass products. This also applies to the selection of the material to be installed. Because it has to be high quality , durable , modern and functional at the same time . That's why we rely on die-cast zinc . A material that is characterized on the one hand by its quality and on the other hand by its load-bearing capacity. Our customers make no compromises here. There is also zinc die-casting with different surfaces. For example, bright chrome-plated, matt chrome-plated or even with a stainless steel look, so that no compromises have to be made in terms of design and individuality. No matter whether for niche showers, shower cubicles or shower partitions (or glass partitions ): die-cast zinc shower fittings offer a whole variety of solutions - and at the ideal price-performance ratio. If you have any further questions about shower fittings and showers made of real glass, we are available to help you by phone, as each installation situation is designed on an individual basis and should be discussed and planned in advance. Contact us today!"
