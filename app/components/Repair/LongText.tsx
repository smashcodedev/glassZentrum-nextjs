      text="Glass repair is simply necessary due to external influences. A good example of this is the soccer ball flying into the glass surface and causing a pile of broken glass or other objects that require repair. Damage to the glass surface can occur in a variety of ways. Whether individual cracks, cracks or even complete destruction of the glass object, the only thing that matters is proper disposal and insurance loss.However, there are numerous reasons why a window pane can crack or break completely, even without outside influence. In some cases, the glass shows an unsightly crack or even a crack out of nowhere. This is about root cause analysis so that any error doesn't happen a second time. Don't worry: with us as your glass professionals, we will find the error through our competent analysis and fix it for you. Here we break down thermal effects such as heat or cold as well as technical errors during installation, production, etc. This is where it gets quite physical. Glass as a material is a poor conductor of heat. If there are intense temperature fluctuations, tensions can occur on the glass surface and the glass deforms. If it is installed incorrectly or incorrectly, it won't take much and the new window pane will quickly turn into a pile of shards. But the placement of a window in relation to the brightness including the effect of shadows can also cause the smallest possible temperature differences (local temperature differences). It is also important to consider the proximity to radiators. The resulting errors are glass damage, which could have been avoided. This is particularly annoying for the owners, because the correct installation of a glass pane begins with advice."
